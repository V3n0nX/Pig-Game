## About The Project

<div align="center">
  <h1 align="center">Pig Game</h1>
  <p>
    A simple browser-based game implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    The game is based on the classic "Pig Game" dice-rolling game where players take turns rolling a die and accumulating points, 
    but if they roll a 1, they lose their accumulated points for that turn.
  </p>
